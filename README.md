JavaScript data visualization is the process of using the JavaScript programming language to create interactive and visually appealing representations of data. It allows you to take raw data and transform it into charts, graphs, maps, or other visual elements that make it easier for users to understand and analyze information. Here's a brief introduction to JavaScript data visualization:

### Purpose: 
JavaScript data visualization is used to convey complex data in a visually comprehensible way. It is commonly employed in web development to enhance user interfaces, reports, dashboards, and data-driven applications.

### Libraries: 
There are several powerful JavaScript libraries and frameworks designed specifically for data visualization. Some of the most popular ones include:

- D3.js (Data-Driven Documents): A highly flexible library for creating interactive data visualizations. It allows you to bind data to DOM elements and apply data-driven transformations to them.
- Chart.js: A simple and easy-to-use library for creating various types of charts, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
- Plotly: A versatile library that supports interactive plotting and charting with features like zooming, panning, and hover interactions.
- Leaflet: A library for creating interactive maps and geospatial visualizations.

Types of Visualizations: JavaScript can be used to create a wide range of data visualizations, including:

- Bar Charts
- Line Charts
- Pie Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Maps
- Heatmaps
- Tree Diagrams

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an interactive web application for visualizing data from the "samples.json" file, providing users with insights into the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in an individual. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The application consists of a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, a gauge chart and a display of demographic information.

### Technologies Used:

- D3.js for data-driven visualizations.
- JavaScript for interactivity.
- HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the web page.
- The "samples.json" file as the data source.
